}

/*
 * Write a program to calculate the total surface area and volume of cuboid.
 * 
 * Input:
 * 
 * The first line of the input contains T denoting the number of testcases. Each
 * of the next T lines contains three space separated positive integers L, B, H
 * denoting the length, width and height of cuboid respectively.
 * 
 * 
 * Output:
 * 
 * For each testcase, output two space separated integers denoting surface area
 * and volume of cuboid respectively.
