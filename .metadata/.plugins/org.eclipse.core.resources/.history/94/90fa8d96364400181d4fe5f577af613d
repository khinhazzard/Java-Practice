/*
 * Write a program to print sum of an AP with n terms with first term a and
 * common difference d.
 * 
 * Input:
 * 
 * The first line of the input contains T denoting the number of testcases. The
 * first line of the test case will be the number of terms of AP and second line
 * its first term and common difference. Output:
 * 
 * For each test case, output will be the sum of AP
 */

//AP - arithmetic progression

//formula: n = number of series digits
//		   t = starting term
//		   d = difference between numbers


//Example:
//
//Input:
//
//1
//5
//1 3
//
//Output: 
//
//35

//5 numbers: 1 + 4 + 7 + 10 + 13 = 35
//1 starting term
//3 difference of numbers
