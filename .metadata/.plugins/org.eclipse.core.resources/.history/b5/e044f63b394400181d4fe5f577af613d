/*
 * 
 * Write a Program to calculate the sum of n terms of a Geometric Progression
 * when first term a and common ratio r is given.
 * 
 * Input: The first line of the input contains T denoting the number of
 * testcases. The first line of the test case will be the number of terms of GP
 * and second line its first term and common ratio.
 * 
 * Output: For each test case the output will be the sum of n terms of GP.
